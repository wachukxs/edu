youtube for schools

how about a youtube where you subscribe for courses, drop your questions as comments, get answered by practically anyone in your class, upload a video of your presentation, get feedbacks from your teachers/colleagues.

there's more. teachers can upload study materials (videos, images, pdfs), give assignments with deadlines, and you guessed it! you can also submit in thesame format.
